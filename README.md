# mega-kings

This is a collaboration within the family of a young boy and girl. Their
aesthetic goals seemed to deviate conveniently upon gender lines, but some
similar themes remain, so we are writing an engine to power both.

## Mega Kings

A war torn dragon-scape exhibits the primal rage of testosterone. The minion
dragons can be only conquered by the most chief of dragons: king k rool. Watch
as he masters his draconic origins (from donkey kong) to be master of dragons.

### TODO

* Change to faint animation and fade npcs
* Add shields

## Unicorns and rainbows

Nirvana and world peace have surely been achieved by each fluffy unicorn, whose
cuteness is surpassed only by that of their peers. Relax and play with the
unicorns and their ilk (leprechauns? rainbows?) and [probably] enjoy some
homesteading features in this sims-em-up hit from 2020.
